If you don't have git installed on your machine then, [install it]( https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/).

# Step 1 : Fork this repo

# Step 2 : Clone the repository
Now clone the forked repository to your device. Click on the clone button and copy to your clipboard.
Open terminal and write command "git clone {url you just copied}"

e.g. if you copied url "https://github.com/mstc/mstc.git" then command will look like this

```

# Step 3 : Create a branch

# Step 4 : Make necessary changes
In contributers.md file add your name, github profile link (optional: do tell us why you are excited about open source)

# Step 5 : Stage changes and make commit
write "git status" command for checking status.
to stage your changes 
```
git add contributers.md
```
to commit these changes
```
git commit -m "add dhyey to Contributors list"
```
(use your name in commit message)

# Step 6: Push changes to github
write this command to push changes but use name of your branch
```
git push origin add-dhyey

for example if name of your branch is add-vrushti then write "git push origin add-vrushti"
